LangChain is an **open-source framework** designed to simplify the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs). Instead of just sending text prompts to an API like OpenAIâ€™s and retrieving responses, LangChain provides **tools and abstractions** to connect LLMs with data sources, external systems, and multi-step workflows.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Open-source development framework** for LLM applications  
- Available in **Python** and **JavaScript (TypeScript)**  
- Focused on **composition** and **modularity**

### Value Adds
1. **Modular Components** â€“ Build applications by plugging together standardized modules (models, prompts, memory, tools).  
2. **Reusable Use Cases** â€“ Pre-built chains and templates for tasks like Q&A, summarization, and chatbots.  
3. **Agents & Tools** â€“ Extend LLMs with external capabilities such as API calls, databases, or custom functions.  
4. **Memory** â€“ Manage conversational context and maintain history across interactions.
