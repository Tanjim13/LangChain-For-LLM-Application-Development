# LangChain-For-LLM-Application-Development
LangChain is an open-source framework designed to make it easier to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs). Instead of just sending text prompts to an API like OpenAIâ€™s and getting responses back, LangChain provides tools to connect LLMs with other systems, data sources, and workflows.
